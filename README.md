Cpp-Qt-BinarySearchTrees
========================

This application contains various implementations of binary search trees, as well as a GUI that (somewhat bizarrely) displays a tree's structure. Implemented approaches include:

+ OptBST: A dynamic programming approach.
+ MidBST: Works by recursively removing the weighted median in the set and placing it into the BST.
+ DistBST: Recursively removes the largest value from the calculated weighted median and places it into the BST.
+ Hu-Tucker: Produces an optimal alphabetic binary search tree through calculating least minimum compatible pairs.
